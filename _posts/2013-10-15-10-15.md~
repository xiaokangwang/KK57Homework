妈妈是个坚强的人。虽然生活中有许多困难要克服，但她从不让困难打倒自己。
My mother was a strong character. Although there were lots of difficulties to overcome, she never let her problems defeat her. 
她对生活的态度永远也不会停止影响我的思想和行动。
Her attitude towards life will never stop influencing my thoughts and actions. 
当我听到有人在背后唱歌时,我的忍耐到了极限.
The last straw was when I heard someone singing behind.
